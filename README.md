UCSD DSC 106 SP21 Project by Jasmine Guan and Sheng Yang

# Overview 
This is a Data Vis project that attempts to analyse the correlation between timbre of US pop music and news sentiment of a period. The leisure or ennui of a decade could be reflected by the soft and comforting tone color of songs, and the occurrence of social unrest may likely be coupled with a sharp and aggressive timbre in music. 

## Data Source: 
- **Timbre Features**: [Audio features of songs ranging from 1922 to 2011](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/msd-audio-features?select=year_prediction.csv);
- **News Sentiment**: [New York Times Articles 1920-2020](https://www.kaggle.com/tumanovalexander/nyt-articles-data).


TODO: well, a lot needs to be done!
